# Biochoric Technology

**Biochoric** focuses on organ and tissue preservation using novel thermodynamic control methods to suppress ice formation and metabolic activity.

## Core Technologies

### [Isochoric Supercooling](supercooling.md)
Preservation at sub-zero temperatures (down to -4°C or lower) in a constant-volume (isochoric) system. This enhances stability against vibration and nucleation.

### [High Entropy CPA (HECPA)](hecpa.md)
A new class of preservation solutions that use high entropy of mixing to suppress ice formation down to deep cryogenic temperatures (-80°C) without the toxicity of standard vitrification agents.

## Key Research

*   **[Rat Heart Preservation](rat_heart.md)**: Demonstration of isochoric preservation efficacy at -4°C (Wan et al., 2018).
