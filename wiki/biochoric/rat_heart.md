# Rat Heart Preservation (Isochoric)

Based on *Wan et al. (2018)*: "Preservation of rat hearts in subfreezing temperature isochoric conditions to -8°C and 78 MPa".

## Experimental Setup
*   **Subject**: Rat hearts.
*   **Medium**: University of Wisconsin (UW) solution.
*   **Conditions**:
    *   Control: 0°C (atmospheric pressure, on ice).
    *   Isochoric: -4°C (41 MPa), -6°C (60 MPa), -8°C (78 MPa).
*   **Duration**: 1 hour.

## Key Findings

### 1. Optimal Condition: -4°C (41 MPa)
*   **Viability**: Physiological performance (heart rate, flow rate) and myocyte structure were comparable to the gold standard (ice storage).
*   **Edema Reduction**: Hearts preserved at -4°C showed **significantly reduced interstitial edema** (p = 0.0009) compared to hearts on ice.
    *   *Significance*: Suggests isochoric supercooling protects against vascular permeability injury better than standard hypothermia.

### 2. Pressure Damage Threshold
*   **-6°C (60 MPa) & -8°C (78 MPa)**: Resulted in severe injury.
    *   Extensive myocyte disruption.
    *   Contraction bands.
    *   Loss of function (hearts failed to beat or beat only in atria).
*   **Conclusion**: There is a critical pressure threshold. While lower temperature reduces metabolism, the associated pressure rise in an isochoric system becomes destructive beyond ~40-50 MPa for hearts.

## Summary
Isochoric preservation at -4°C improves upon standard ice storage by reducing edema, but lower temperatures (and thus higher pressures) are detrimental to whole-organ structure.
