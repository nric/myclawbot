# High Entropy Cryoprotective Agents (HECPA)

Based on *Patent Application BCHR-001PRV*: "High Entropy Solutions, Methods for Producing the Same, and Devices and Methods for Preserving Biological Matter With High Entropy Solutions".

## The Core Concept
Standard cryopreservation has a "dead zone" between **-20°C** (limit of supercooling) and **~-100°C** (glass transition/vitrification). In this zone, ice formation is nearly inevitable with standard solutions unless toxic concentrations of cryoprotectants are used.

**HECPA** (High Entropy Solutions) solves this by maximizing the **entropy of mixing** of the solution. High entropy stabilizes the liquid phase and suppresses ice nucleation, allowing for ice-free preservation in the -20°C to -80°C range (and potentially down to -196°C) using lower, non-toxic concentrations of chemicals.

## Definition
A High Entropy Solution consists of:
*   **Base**: Water (mol fraction 0.65 - 0.99).
*   **Solutes**: Two or more (up to 100) non-water components with different physical/thermodynamic properties.
*   **Threshold**: Entropy of mixing $\ge 7 \text{ J/(mol K)}$.

## Mechanism
The "High Entropy" effect leverages the thermodynamic relationship where increased entropy of the system lowers the free energy of the liquid state relative to the solid (ice) state, or kinetically frustrates the organization of water molecules into an ice lattice.
*   **Molar Volume Diversity**: Mixing components with vastly different molar volumes (e.g., 40 mL/mol to 150+ mL/mol) significantly increases entropy.

## Typical Formulation (Example)
A specific embodiment describes a mix of solutes in descending order of mole fraction:
1.  **Hexylene glycol** (Highest non-water fraction)
2.  Sorbitol
3.  Glucose
4.  Xylitol
5.  Butylene glycol
6.  Propylene glycol
7.  Glycerol
8.  Ethanol
9.  **Ethylene glycol** (Lowest fraction)

## Applications
*   **Ice-Free Storage at -80°C**: Enables storage of organs/tissues in standard lab freezers without potentially damaging vitrification or dangerous ice formation.
*   **Low Toxicity**: Achieves suppression of ice with a high water content (up to 99% mol fraction), unlike vitrification which requires >40% solute concentration.
