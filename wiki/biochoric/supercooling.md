# Isochoric Supercooling Stability

Based on *Powell-Palm, Koh-Bell, and Rubinsky (2020)*: "Isochoric conditions enhance stability of metastable supercooled water".

## Key Findings

1.  **Enhanced Stability**: Isochoric (constant-volume) conditions substantially increase the stability of supercooled water against macroscopic perturbations (impact, vibration, ultrasonication, thermal fluctuation).
2.  **Mechanism**: The stability is driven by a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic factors:
    *   **Cavitation Resistance**: Isochoric conditions suppress cavitation. The formation of a low-density air bubble in a constrained volume creates positive pressure (Le Chatelier’s principle), increasing the energetic barrier to bubble formation. Cavitation bubbles are primary nucleation sites.
    *   **Density Fluctuations**: Restriction of microscopic density fluctuations.
    *   **Interface Elimination**: Elimination of the air-water interface (though this is also achieved by oil sealing, isochoric performs better).

## Experimental Results

*   **Isochoric vs. Oil-Sealed**: Isochoric conditions outperformed oil-sealed isobaric conditions, proving that the effect goes beyond just removing the air interface.
*   **Ultrasonication**: Isochoric chambers showed ~90% stability, whereas isobaric systems froze immediately.
*   **Vibration**: Isochoric systems maintained 100% stability under vibrational loads comparable to commercial flight.

## Implications for Preservation

*   Enables transport of supercooled biological matter without freezing due to road/flight vibrations.
*   Suggests that rigid containment is a key design parameter for organ preservation boxes.
