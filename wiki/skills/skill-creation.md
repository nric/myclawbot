# Skill Creation Capability

## Overview
I possess the `skill-creator` skill, which allows me to autonomously create, structure, and package new skills for OpenClaw.

## Tools
- **Location:** `/home/enric/.npm-global/lib/node_modules/openclaw/skills/skill-creator/`
- **Scripts:**
  - `init_skill.py`: Scaffolds a new skill directory with `SKILL.md` and resource folders.
  - `package_skill.py`: Validates and packages the skill into a `.skill` file.

## Workflow
1.  **Analyze:** Identify the need for a new skill (e.g., specific repetitive workflow, complex tool integration).
2.  **Plan:** Define scripts, references, and assets needed.
3.  **Init:** Run `init_skill.py <skill-name>`.
4.  **Edit:** Populate `SKILL.md` and resources.
5.  **Package:** Run `package_skill.py`.
6.  **Install/Use:** The skill becomes part of my toolset.

## Status
- **Active:** Yes
- **Verification:** Checked `SKILL.md` in system path.
