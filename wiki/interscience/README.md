# InterScience

**InterScience** is a Swiss-based medical technology company focused on next-generation tissue ablation energies.

## Core Technology: E² (E-Squared)
E² is the successor to Irreversible Electroporation (IRE). It uses a proprietary energy delivery method (Modulated Exponential Decay Pulses) combined with electrolytic effects to achieve:
*   **Non-thermal ablation**: Preserves extracellular matrix, vessels, and nerves.
*   **Selectivity**: Targets cancer cells while sparing healthy structures.
*   **Speed**: Significantly faster than traditional IRE and Microwave ablation.

## Products
*   **QuickPulse**: The first commercial generator system utilizing E² energy for image-guided needle ablation.

## Key Markets
*   Prostate Cancer (Focal therapy)
*   Liver Cancer
*   Lung Cancer
*   Immuno-Oncology combinations
