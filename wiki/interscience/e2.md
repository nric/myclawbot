# E² (E-Squared) Technology

**E²** stands for the next evolution of **Irreversible Electroporation (IRE)**, incorporating **Electrolysis** as a fundamental component of the ablation mechanism.

## The Problem with Traditional IRE
While IRE is safer than thermal ablation (RF/Microwave) because it spares collagen structures (vessels, ducts), it has limitations:
*   **Muscle Contraction**: High-voltage pulses cause severe muscle stimulation, requiring paralysis during surgery.
*   **Speed**: Treatment of large volumes can be slow (minutes).
*   **Technique Sensitivity**: Needle placement must be extremely precise.

## The E² Solution
E² utilizes a **Modulated Exponential Decay Pulse**.
*   **Electrolysis Integration**: Unlike standard IRE which treats electrolysis as a side effect, E² embraces it. The parameter space of E² intentionally produces electrolytic products that enhance cell death (pH changes, chemical cytotoxicity) alongside the electroporation effect.
*   **Pulse Shape**: The specific decay shape reduces the threshold for muscle stimulation while maintaining the electric field strength needed for cell membrane disruption.

## Key Advantages
1.  **Faster**: Up to 1000% faster than IRE for large volumes.
2.  **Safety**: Maintains the non-thermal safety profile of IRE (spares nerves/vessels).
3.  **No/Low Muscle Stimulation**: Reduces the need for deep paralytics.
4.  **Robustness**: Less sensitive to exact needle geometry than standard IRE.

## Intellectual Property
The technology is covered by a broad field patent that includes all electroporation parameters that generate significant electrolytic effects, effectively securing the "next generation" parameter space.
